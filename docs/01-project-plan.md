# StrataHub — Project Plan & Vision

## 1. Executive Summary

**StrataHub** is a modern, mobile-first strata management platform designed for the Australian market. It replaces outdated, clunky strata management software with a beautifully designed portal that connects **owners, residents, strata managers, and committee members** in one unified platform.

Australia has **3.2 million+ strata-titled properties** across 350,000+ schemes, and this number is growing rapidly as apartment living becomes the norm in major cities. The strata management industry is worth **$7B+** and is dominated by legacy software that frustrates everyone involved.

**StrataHub** solves this by delivering a **Slack-meets-Xero experience** for strata — real-time communication, transparent financials, effortless maintenance tracking, and digital voting.

| Compliance is complex & state-specific | Strata managers | Spreadsheets + manual tracking |
| Communication is fragmented | Everyone | Email chains, notice boards |
